# Hyperspectral Sounder

What is a hyperspectral sounder?

## Properties


## Atmospheric Profile Retrieval

Since these hyperspectral infrared sounders have high spectral resolution in the infrared area,
and spectral information contain the information of atmospheric state and vertical profile,
we can retrieve these atmospheric properties from the measurements.
